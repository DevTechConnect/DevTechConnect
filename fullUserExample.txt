You definitely want to be able to work with JavaScript before you dive into jQuery. Like we indicated in the HTML and CSS track, skipping some steps can limit your knowledge on the tools available, but once you have a good grasp on JavaScript, you’ll love and appreciate jQuery. Their slogan is ‘Write less, do more.” This may not seem like a huge necessity now, but when you are working on real life web pages, and you’re staring down hundreds of pages of code and thousands upon thousands of lines, every shortcut you can take helps.\nKeep clicking through.
